Now we created the object of this class from a main method. The code will compile and run successfully to give a output. Thus, this proofs that <b>we can have a private constructor in a class</b>.<br /><br /><pre class="brush : java">class A <br />{<br /><br />  private A(){<br />    System.out.println("Private Constructor of A");<br />  }<br /><br />  public static void main(String args[]){<br />    System.out.println("Hello World");<br />    A obj = new A();<br /><br />  }<br />}</pre><pre class="output">Hello World<br />Private Constructor of A</pre><div class="hl-note"><b>What happens if we try to create an object of a class with &nbsp;a Private Constructor.</b></div>Now, if we have a class with a private constructor and we try to create the object of this class e.g. If we have a class A and another class B, both with private constructors and we try to create object of class B from class A. This will throw a compile time exception stating that we can not create the object of class B because we cannot access its default constructor. <b>Thus we cannot create the object of a class that has a private constructor.</b>&nbsp; Remember that, a whenever an object of a class is created, its default constructor must be accessible by the class that is trying to create its object.<br /><pre class="brush : java">class B{<br /><br />  private B(){<br />    System.out.println("Private Constructor of B");<br />  }<br /><br />}<br /><br />class A <br />{<br /><br />  private A(){<br />    System.out.println("Private Constructor of A");<br />  }<br /><br />  public static void main(String args[]){<br />    System.out.println("Hello World");<br />    A objectA = new A();<br />    B objectB = new B();<br /><br />  }<br />}</pre><br /><pre class="output">A.java:19: error: B() has private access in B<br />    B objectB = new B();<br />                ^<br />1 error</pre><br /><div class="hl-note"><b>What happens if we try to inherit a class with a Private Constructor.</b></div>Now, if we create a class B with a private constructor and try to inherit this class, we will get a compile time error stating that the class B have a private constructor. This means that&nbsp;<b>a class with the private constructor can not be inherited</b>.<br /><br class="Apple-interchange-newline" /><span style="font-family: monospace;"><span style="white-space: pre;">class B{    private B(){     System.out.println("Private Constructor of B");   }  }  class A extends B {    private A(){     System.out.println("Private Constructor of A");   }    public static void main(String args[]){     System.out.println("Hello World");   } }</span></span></div> <pre class="output">A.java:12: error: B() has private access in B<br />  private A(){<br />             ^<br />1 error</pre>Thus we cannot extend a class or make an object of a class that has a private constructor because its default constructor becomes inaccessible. When we inherit a class the default constructor of the super class is executed before the constructor of the base class is executed. Also when we make an object of a class its default constructor is accessed before any other method is accessed. <b>Thus constructor must be accessible for making the object of a class or inheriting a class. We can that a class with a private constructor can not be inherited nor we can make the object of this class.</b></div>
