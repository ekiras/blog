<div class="markdown"><h2>Gradle Build Lifecycle Phases</h2><p>A gradle build has three phases</p><ol><li><code>Initialization</code> - In this phase the gradle build is initialized. Gradle scans the project and its sub projects to create a <code>Project</code> instance of each project and sub project.</li><li><code>Configuration</code> - In this phase the gradle build is configured. In this phase a <code>Task tree</code> is created which determines how and when to run the tasks.</li><li><code>Execution</code> - In this phase the gradle build is executed. This phase actually runs the tasks configured in the configuration phase.</li></ol><h2>What are the Gradle Build Phases</h2><p>Lets take the following example</p><h3>build.gradle</h3><pre><code class="language-gradle"><br />println 'This is executed during the configuration phase.'<br /><br />task configured {<br />    println 'This is also executed during the configuration phase.'<br />}<br /><br />task test {<br />    doLast {<br />        println 'This is executed during the execution phase.'<br />    }<br />}<br /><br />task testBoth {<br />    doFirst {<br />      println 'This is executed first during the execution phase.'<br />    }<br />    doLast {<br />      println 'This is executed last during the execution phase.'<br />    }<br />    println 'This is executed during the configuration phase as well.'<br />}<br /></code></pre><p>The above example is self explanatory and tell you about the gradle build lifecycle phases. When run it will give the following output.</p><pre><code>This is executed during the initialization phase.<br />This is executed during the configuration phase.<br />This is also executed during the configuration phase.<br />This is executed during the configuration phase as well.<br />:test<br />This is executed during the execution phase.<br />:testBoth<br />This is executed first during the execution phase.<br />This is executed last during the execution phase.<br /><br />BUILD SUCCESSFUL<br /><br />Total time: 1 secs<br /></code></pre><blockquote><p><strong>Also Read</strong></p><ul><li><a href="www.ekiras.com/p/gradle.html">Introduction to Gradle</a></li><li><a href="http://www.ekiras.com/2016/12/what-is-gradle-task-alias-short-forms.html">Gradle task Short hand notations</a></li><li><a href="http://www.ekiras.com/2016/12/how-to-run-single-or-multiple-gradle-tasks.html">How to run a specific gradle task or multiple tasks</a></li><li><a href="http://www.ekiras.com/2016/12/difference-between-dofirst-and-dolast-methods-in-gradle-task.html">Difference between doFirst() and doLast() methods</a></li><li><a href="http://www.ekiras.com/2016/12/what-is-gradle-daemon.html">What is a Gradle Daemon</a></li></ul></blockquote></div>
