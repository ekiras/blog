    <div class="hl-note"><b>Points To Remember</b></div>
    <ul style="text-align: left;">
        <li>HashMap implements the Map Interface.</li>
        <li>It works on the principles of hashing.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>It stores and retrieves data in a key value pair.</li>
        <li>HashMap can have only one key as a null element.</li>
        <li>HashMap stores both key and value in form of Entry object&nbsp;<b>Map.Entry.&nbsp;</b></li>
        <li>Initial capacity of HashMap is 16. (Since jdk 1.7 we can have HashMap with initial capacity as 0).</li>
        <li>Default load Factor of a HashMap is 0.75, after this a HashMap gets rehashed.&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="hl-note"><b>Q1 : How does HashMap work internally ?&nbsp;</b></div>
    We add data to the HashMap in key-value pair, by method <b>put(key, value).</b>&nbsp;When we do this, the <b>hashCode() </b>method
    is <b>called upon the key</b> to return a hashcode, this hashcode is an integer value 16 digit long by default. This
    hashcode is then used by the HashMap's <b>internal hashing method</b> to find a <b>bucket location</b>&nbsp;to store
    the Entry object. At this bucket location both key and value is saved in the bucket. Since we know that different
    objects can result into the same hashcode, thus all the keys that result into the same hashcode are stored in the
    same bucket in form of a linklist. This linklist however is not the same as java.util.LinkedList, it is a much
    simpler implementation of list as compared to java.util.LinkedList.<br/>
    <ul style="text-align: left;">
        <li>This second hash function is provided by the implementation of HashMap and cannot be overridden by the
            developer. This is a static method and looks like <br/>
            <pre class="brush : java">static int hash(int h) {<br/>    // This function ensures that hashCodes that differ only by<br/>    // constant multiples at each bit position have a bounded<br/>    // number of collisions (approximately 8 at default load factor).<br/>    h ^= (h &gt;&gt;&gt; 20) ^ (h &gt;&gt;&gt; 12);<br/>    return h ^ (h &gt;&gt;&gt; 7) ^ (h &gt;&gt;&gt; 4);<br/>}<br/></pre>
        </li>
        <li>Each hashmap has an Array and in that Array places the entries in a position according to the keys hashcode
            (e.g. position = hashcode % arraysize).
        </li>
        <li>If more than one entry ends up in the same bucket those entries are stored in a linked list. Thus the
            bucket-metaphor: each array-entry is a "bucket" where you just dump in all the matching keys.We use array to
            get the desired <b>"constant time"</b> behaviour since we need to <b>Access random positions</b> in this
            list.
        </li>
        <li>Whereas within a bucket you have to traverse all elements until finding the desired key anyways, so you can
            use a linked list as it is easier to append to (no resize needed).
        </li>
        <li>If key is null, then Null keys always map to hash 0, thus index 0.</li>
        <li>If both the hashCode() and equals() return the same value for key then, its value is overridden if it
            exists.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <div>This also Shows the Need for a good hashfunction, because if all keys hash to only a few values you will get
        Long linked lists to search and a lot of (fast to access) empty buckets.
    </div>
    <br/>
    <div class="hl-note"><b>Q2 :&nbsp;</b><b>How do we retrieve values from a HashMap ?</b></div>
    We retrieve from HashMap using the <b>get(key) </b>method. As stated above, first the hashcode is found by the <b>hashCode()
    method </b>and then this hashcode is applied to the static <b>hash() </b>&nbsp;method of the hashmap to find the
    bucket location. Once the bucket location is found, that is actually a link list. We traverse from first element of
    the list to the last element applying <b>equals()</b>&nbsp;method to find the value corresponding to the key.<br/>
    <div class="hl-note"><b>Q3 :&nbsp;</b><b>What will happen if two keys have same hashcode ?</b></div>
    Yes, this is also a main concern that two different objects can produce same hashcode, thus this is the main reason
    why this hashode is again rehashed using internal hashing algorithm of the HashMap. When we get two objects with
    same hashcode, their bucket location will be same. Therefore both the key value pairs will be stored in the same
    bucket in the form of a linklist.<br/>

    For example, in the above shown image the keys "John Smith" and "Sandra Dee" produces the same hashcode(). So same
    hashcode will point to the same bucket location, e.g in our case, lets say that bucket location is 152. Now in case
    we search for "Sandra Dee", we will apply equals() method to all the keys in the link list of this bucket until one
    of them return true. This returned value will be the value corresponding to that key.Image 2 above, shows how
    key-value elements are stored in an Entry object, how keys with same hashcode are stored in a singly linkedlist and
    how &nbsp;an array of these bucket locations are stored in an array.<br/>
    <div class="hl-note"><b>Q4 :&nbsp;</b><b>Why Strings, Integers and other Wrapper classes considered as good keys ?&nbsp;</b>
    </div>
    Any class that implements the <b>hashCode()</b> and <b>equals()</b>&nbsp;methods of the java.lang.Object are
    considered as good keys. Using <b>immutable, final object with proper equals() and hashcode() implementation</b>
    would <b>act as perfect</b> Java HashMap <b>keys</b> and <b>improve performance</b> of Java HashMap <b>by reducing
    collision</b>. <b>Immutability</b> also <b>allows caching</b> there hashcode of different keys which makes overall
    retrieval process very fast, if unequal object return different hashcode than chances of collision will be less
    which subsequently improve performance of HashMa. Thus String and various wrapper classes e.g. Integer very good
    keys in Java HashMap.
