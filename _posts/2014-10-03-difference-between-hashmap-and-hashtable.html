<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div class="hl-note"><b>Points To Remember</b></div><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>HashTable have the legacy code and were introduced before HashMaps.</li><li>There is nothing in a HashTable that a HashMap cannot do except multithreading.</li><li>ConcurrentHashMap is a replacement for HashTable, it a synchronized HashMap.</li></ul><div class="hl-note"><b>Differences : HashMap and HashTable&nbsp;</b></div><table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="table-bg" style="width: 100%;"><tbody><tr><th width="50%">HashMap</th><th width="50%">HashTable</th></tr><tr><td>They implement Map Interface.</td><td>It extends Dictionary(obsolete from jdk 1.7) class and implements Map interface</td></tr><tr><td>They are a part of Collections API</td><td>They are not a part of Collections API</td></tr><tr><td>They allow a single null key and any number of null values.</td><td>They do not allow null values to be added.</td></tr><tr><td>They are not synchronized or thread-safe</td><td>They are synchronized or thread-safe</td></tr><tr><td>They use Iterator to iterate over objects</td><td>They use Enumeration to iterate over objects</td></tr><tr><td>They are faster and uses less memory</td><td>They are comparatively slower.</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="hl-note"><b>Similarities : HashMap and HashTable&nbsp;</b></div><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Both of them implements Map interface.</li><li>Both HashMap and Hashtable works on the Principle of Hashing.</li><li>Both HashMap and HashTable do not guarantee that the order of the map will remain constant over time.</li></ul><div>I recommend not to use HashTable and use HashMap since HashMap is much faster than the HashTables and it allows you to do everything that a HashTable allows you to do. In case you are in need of using a Map in a multithreaded environment than you should go for ConcurrentHashMap. A ConcurrentHashMap provides all the functions of a HAshMap and it is also thread safe or simple multithreaded.</div></div>
